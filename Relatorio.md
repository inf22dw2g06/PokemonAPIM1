# PokedexAPI
This is the "Relatorio" of the project. This project is another way to do the project like the others we did on Web Development I but with other methods and other technologies like Sequelize and OAuth2.0

## First steps
The beggining of the project wasn't very hard because we followed some tutorials and documentations of the different tools. The hard stuff starts with the relations between resources

## Development and ideas
To do the relations was a very hard thing to do because we didn't understand very well how the creation of the relations works. We did not know how to implement the relations because there were a lot of ways and then we realized that we were doing it wrong because if we wanted to use an existing database we had to use sequelize cli with the migrations, seeds and that stuff.

## Sequelize
We did not know about sequelize and it is a very good way to implement the databases and to work with the tables and the relations between them because it makes it very easy to do the implementations with just commands using sequelize-cli to create the seeds, migrations and the models of the tables.

## OAuth2.0
To do the authentification and authorization part we used the Github OAuth2.0 method. Firstly we did not understand it very well and we were strugling a bit with it but then we knew how it works and we implemented it 

## Dockerhub
This time, with dockerhub we only had to "recycle" the dockerfiles of the Web Development I subject and make some changes. Unfortunately it does not work as it should and it is very strange because we think it is well implemented.

## Conclusions
To make this project it was very interesting to learn about Sequelize and the OAuth2.0 because those are new tools we can use in the future and the OAuth2.0 part is a very important thing to learn to implement it on future projects just to have security in all our projects
